<h1>Introduction</h1>

This is my 2nd project working with Jenkins. This one looks like a little more complex compared to the previous one, but still not follows the entire approach of Jenkins.
In this project we can build my favourite "online" music streamer, the Ampache from a Jenkinsfile.

<h1>Prerequisities</h1>

We only need to have is a [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/SandorJokai/Jenkins/project-02/Jenkinsfile). No, seriously. But of course, there are some more requirements. However those "more" will be added through the Jenkinsfile.
So, I have another [Github repository](https://github.com/SandorJokai/docker/ampache-streamer) where the Jenkinsfile will be working with.
